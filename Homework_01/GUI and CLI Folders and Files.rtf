\f0\fs24 \cf0 GUI and CLI Folders and Files\
\
GUI, or graphical user interface, is the more user-friendly way to organize files on the computer. It is the way that I was taught when I first started learning how to use a computer, and until now, I thought it was the way that everyone organized and found files. However, CLI, or command line interface, seems to be the more reliable way. It will also be helpful to get used to CLI because coding itself is not very visual, but instead the bones to make something visual. As with most new programs or skillsets learned on the computer, there are commands that I must learn in order to navigate and utilize CLI. In the video, it was made clear that all of these commands can be googled and will be memorized with frequent practice. While CLI does look like an intimidating way to navigate my computer, it will simplify as time goes on. Right now, I still like GUI better because I know it. Hopefully, I'll feel comfortable with both soon and be able to use one or the other whenever there is a need to. }
