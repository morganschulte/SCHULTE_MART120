# Learning Style
## Morgan Schulte

My learning style is 35% auditory, 40% visual, and 25% tactile. I knew I was a visual learner, but I think I'm better at tactile learning that auditory. I'm almost positive that that's the case due to not being able to focus in in-person lectures. It is part of why I'm going to school online. I think the best way for me to learn is through videos and hands on graphics like coding games. So far, the media arts program is spot on for my style of learning.
