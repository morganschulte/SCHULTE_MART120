# Mindset Synopsis
## Morgan Schulte

I knew that logically I have a growth mindset. The quiz reinforced this. However, my first reactions to real life difficulties are more of a fixed mindset until I'm able to pull back and think things over. I think that it is almost a survival instinct to assume others probably will not change. I understand the positive impact that a growth mindset can have on a person, but I do think it takes practice to make that the default. I think there's always room to grow, but humans are creatures of habit. I'd like to think that at least in school, it is important to have a growth mindset at all times so that you can focus on how much you will learn rather than how much there is to do.
