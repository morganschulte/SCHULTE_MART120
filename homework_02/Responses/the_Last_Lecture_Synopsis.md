# The Last Lecture Synopsis
## Morgan Schulte

The Last Lecture was extremely empowering. Randy Pausch clearly has a positive outlook on the life and legacy he was leaving behind. First and foremost he stated his intentions as to what he did and did not want to talk about. This is important because it set the tone of focusing on the positive. It was clear that he had figured that out with help. He spoke of his football coach that was being hard on him and that the assistant coach made sure to remind Randy that his critics care enough to take the time to tell him what he is doing wrong. This lead to the most impactful part for me personally, which was the ways in which Randy sought out both experiences and mentors. Obviously he sought out experiences as he completed nearly every childhood dream he had. But he also sought out mentors to push him forward, and then remembered and credited all of them. One example is his willingness to reach people personally as he started his journey through Disney. He also took the time to acknowledge his wife during his lecture. Also, when he was told "no", he would just reroute but end up at the same destination. This happened within both Disney, getting on the zero gravity flight, and his university. He was innovative and had an energy that he brought with him to everything he did. The fact that people from all different majors came to see the final presentations for his VR course was very telling of the positive environment he created around him. I found myself in a positive mood for the entire lecture besides when his wife was crying (but still smiling) and at the end when he mentions the lecture was really for his children.
